## Installation

```console
npm install @wthek/express-middleware
```

## Usage

**Add Middleware Just Before Starting the Server**

To catch all errors correctly, place `KitExpressMiddleware()` after all routes but before starting your Express server.

```Javascript
import express from "express";
import { KitHttpError, BadRequestError } from "http-error-kit";
import { KitExpressMiddleware } from "@wthek/express-middleware";

const app = express();

// Routes
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  throw new BadRequestError("Invalid request!");
});

// Error Handling Middleware (must be after routes)
app.use(KitExpressMiddleware());

// Start Server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

## How It Works

-   Catches errors thrown in routes and middleware
-   Checks if the error is an instance of any `http-error-kit` Errors
-   Formats the error response and sets the correct HTTP status code
-   Passes other errors to the next middleware (_so they can be handled separately_)

## Why Use `@wthek/express-middleware`?

-   **No more manual error handling** – Status codes are automatically set.
-   **Consistent API responses** – Standardized errors improve debugging & logging.
-   **Works perfectly with `http-error-kit`** – Fully compatible with existing `http-error-kit` error structures.
